          Fantasy Critic was created by me, Steve Fallon. The visual design for the site was created by <a href="http://dalemahabir.rocks/" target="_blank">Dale Mahabir <font-awesome-icon icon="external-link-alt" size="sm" /></a>.
          As of now, this site is brand new and there are bound to be bugs, oversights, and design issues. However, I am committed to improving the site for the foreseeable future.
          I created this site because I wanted to merge my love of video games with my love of fantasy football. I think anyone that likes both of those things will have a great time playing Fantasy Critic.

      <h2>A little history</h2>
      <div class="text-well">
        <p>
          I had the idea for Fantasy Critic in late 2017. I was already a big fantasy football fan, and I had a group of friends that I wanted to form a league with. Problem: most of them don't really like football.
          So I got to thinking about how to apply the idea of fantasy football to something we do all like. I'm not totally sure when the moment was, but that's about when I had the idea for Fantasy Critic.
          Before it was ever a website, it was a 3 page document outlining the basic rules. Some of the details have changed, but the core idea of the game hasn't changed since then. My friends and I played through
          all of 2018 using a Google Sheet as our record keeper.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrote the first bits of code that would become this site in January 2018, but I didn't really begin in earnest until June. For most of the second half of 2018, I worked on Fantasy Critic nearly every day.
          I hired a friend of mine, Dale Mahabir, to help with the visual design of the site in late September. Things started taking shape quickly in the last few months of the year. I "soft" launched the site
          in December 2018, by posting on a few programming subreddits.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the time I'm writing this (early January 2019), the site is "officially" launched, but we're just getting started. The site's first major advertisement -
          on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZrxXp1reP8E353rZsB3jaA" target="_blank">Easy Allies <font-awesome-icon icon="external-link-alt" size="sm" /></a> Podcast - airs in about a week.
          I couldn't be more excited for people to start playing. I hope you find it as entertaining as my friends and I already have.
