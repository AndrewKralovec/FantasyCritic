## Fantasy Critic
Fantasy Critic is like fantasy football...but for video games! You and several friends will create your own virtual video game “Publishers”,
          and then you will assemble a roster of the games you believe will review the best. Similar to fantasy football, the players will alternate
          picking games in a snake draft style to start the year. At the end of the year, the winner is the team with the best lineup of video games
          based on scores from <a href="https://opencritic.com/">opencritic.com</a>.

You can see the site at  <a href="https://www.fantasycritic.games/">fantasycritic.games</a>
